## Installation

This project uses the Gatsby.js Framework (which uses React.js). It's also managed with Yarn 2.

To start developing:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `yarn develop`

We're using the [Zero-Installs](https://next.yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) configuration, so there's no need to run `yarn` after installing.
